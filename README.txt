Hello Guys,
This is My  Project Instagram  Mini Which is built using Javascript and Frontend Technologies. I've used Object-oriented
programming to build it.

Note:Please Open this App only in Desktop as it is made considering  Desktop only.

Instruction to Use:
*Firstly Allow Camera Permission Then you are good to go.

When you open this you will find the Reel section where you can find some filters and try them out. Then we have the Page button at the bottom, that would make you go 
to the Reels page where you see some reels. All the buttons other than this are dummy. So when you are Reel page if you want to go
back look for the blue button at the top left which would take you back to the previous page. And Yeah that's all.
